The "datamining" results are obtained by running the bash file: datamining\_combine.bash.

The topo1 directory has a different structure, so this bash file is customised to run within that directory.

The final results must be combined by the results obtained from executing this bash file in this directory (sdn\_results) and the similar bash file (of the same name) in the topo1 directory.

In total, there are 6327 + 5445 = 11.772 experiment points, 1209 + 1767 = 2976 points containing potential conflicts (anomalies).
